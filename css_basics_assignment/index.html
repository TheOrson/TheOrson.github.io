        <p class="text-example">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of web pages. It allows developers to define the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design of a site, separating structure from content. By applying CSS to HTML, designers can create responsive and visually appealing web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. CSS also enables advanced features like animations, transitions, and custom styles for interactive elements, making it essential for modern web development.</p>
